Log into the switch and enter enable mode

Identify the host/source and destinations ports that will be monitored/forwarded:
Source port is the port that has the data we need and destination port is the port that it is being forwarded to.
In this case I used port 1 as the destination port and port 47 as the source port
The switch will display the port number as soon as you plug in a cable into it - if this does not happen you can use the below:

Switch>en
Switch#show ip interface brief | include up

Run the commands below to set up the monitoring:
Switch#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#monitor session 1 source interface gigabitethernet1/0/47 both
Switch(config)#monitor session 1 destination interface gigabitethernet1/0/1
Switch(config)#end

Confirm that monitoring has been set up successfully:
Switch>en
Switch#show monitor session all

On the destination device, capture the data flow with wireshark or similar.
