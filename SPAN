Log into the switch (you can use your newly acquired SSH skills here)

Connect 2 ethernet cables; 1 from the switch to the server (or in this case your samtop) and the other from the switch to any other device that generates traffic of some sort.

Identify the host/source and destinations ports that will be monitored/forwarded:
Source port is the port that has the data we need and destination port is the port that it is being forwarded to.
The switch will display the port number as soon as you plug a cable into it - if this does not happen you can use the below:

Switch>en
Switch#show ip interface brief | include up

Run the commands below to set up the monitoring:
Switch#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Switch(config)#monitor session 1 source interface gigabitethernet1/0/47 both
Switch(config)#monitor session 1 destination interface gigabitethernet1/0/1
Switch(config)#end

Confirm that monitoring has been set up successfully:
Switch>en
Switch#show monitor session all

On the destination device, capture the data flow with wireshark or similar.
